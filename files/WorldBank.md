# The World Bank Analysis <br>

Living in the United States we don't often think about international development. But I feel that there is a good case to be made for aiding other countries in their development to help all people enjoy the things we do in the United States. The International Development Association (IDA) does just that. As part of The World Bank the IDA extends credits, grants, and guarentees to its member countries to help them acheive their goals. <br>
How much money does the IDA grant to its members? Who is the biggest recipient of these funds? What are these funds being used for? I decided to pull the IDA's Statement of Credits and Grants to find out.
